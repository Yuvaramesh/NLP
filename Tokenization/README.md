# Tokenization

**Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, artificial intelligence, information engineering, and human-computer interaction. This field focuses on how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.**

### Overview
- This project focuses on implementing tokenization using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text into individual units, typically words or phrases, called tokens. In NLP, tokenization is a fundamental step in various language processing tasks, such as text analysis, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

### Key Features
#### Advanced Tokenization Algorithm:
- The project incorporates a sophisticated tokenization algorithm designed to handle diverse text inputs effectively.
- This algorithm ensures accurate segmentation of text into meaningful tokens, considering language-specific nuances.

#### Customization Options: 
- Users have the flexibility to customize tokenization rules and parameters.
- This includes setting minimum token length, specifying stopwords, and adjusting other parameters to tailor the tokenization process according to specific use cases.

#### Language Compatibility: 
- The tokenization module is designed to support multiple languages, making it suitable for global applications.
- It incorporates language-specific tokenization models to enhance accuracy and adaptability.
### Getting Started
- Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or Spacy library

### Need of Tokenization

#### Effective Text Processing: 
- Tokenization reduces the size of raw text so that it can be handled more easily for processing and analysis.
#### Feature extraction:
- Text data can be represented numerically for algorithmic comprehension by using tokens as features in machine learning models.
#### Language Modelling: 
- Tokenization in NLP facilitates the creation of organised representations of language, which is useful for tasks like text generation and language modelling.
#### Information Retrieval: 
- Tokenization is essential for indexing and searching in systems that store and retrieve information efficiently based on words or phrases.
#### Text Analysis:
- Tokenization is used in many NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis and named entity recognition, to determine the function and context of individual words in a sentence.
#### Vocabulary Management: 
- By generating a list of distinct tokens that stand in for words in the dataset, tokenization helps manage a corpusâ€™s vocabulary.
#### Task-Specific Adaptation:
- Tokenization can be customised to meet the needs of particular NLP tasks, meaning that it will work best in applications such as summarization and machine translation.
#### Preprocessing Step: 
- This essential preprocessing step transforms unprocessed text into a format appropriate for additional statistical and computational analysis.

### Example:

- from tokenizer import Tokenizer
- tokenizer = Tokenizer()
- text = "This is an example sentence."
- tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
- print(tokens)

from nltk.tokenize import RegexpTokenizer
tokenizer = RegexpTokenizer("[\w']")
text = "Let's see how it's working."
tokenizer.tokenize(text)
