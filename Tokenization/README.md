### Tokenization
### Overview
- This project focuses on implementing tokenization using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text into individual units, typically words or phrases, called tokens. In NLP, tokenization is a fundamental step in various language processing tasks, such as text analysis, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

### Key Features
#### Advanced Tokenization Algorithm:
- The project incorporates a sophisticated tokenization algorithm designed to handle diverse text inputs effectively.
- This algorithm ensures accurate segmentation of text into meaningful tokens, considering language-specific nuances.

#### Customization Options: 
- Users have the flexibility to customize tokenization rules and parameters.
- This includes setting minimum token length, specifying stopwords, and adjusting other parameters to tailor the tokenization process according to specific use cases.

#### Language Compatibility: 
- The tokenization module is designed to support multiple languages, making it suitable for global applications.
- It incorporates language-specific tokenization models to enhance accuracy and adaptability.
### Getting Started
- Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or Spacy library
