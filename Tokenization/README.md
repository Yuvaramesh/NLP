### Tokenization
### Overview
- This project focuses on implementing tokenization using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text into individual units, typically words or phrases, called tokens. In NLP, tokenization is a fundamental step in various language processing tasks, such as text analysis, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.**

### Features
- Tokenization Algorithm: The project employs a state-of-the-art tokenization algorithm to efficiently break down input text into tokens.
#### Customization:
- Users can customize tokenization rules and parameters based on their specific requirements.
#### Compatibility: 
- The project supports tokenization for multiple languages and is designed to handle various text formats.
